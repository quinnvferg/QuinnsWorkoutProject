210 FInal Project Code

This is my 210 Project where based on user input you are able to get a personalized workout plan!
Key Points:
- Strength vs Endurance (it will calculate what your max bench / endurance bench should be based on your body weight and body fat percentage)
- Different available Splits ( You are able to select different splits depending on what works best for you! 3 days a week 5 days a week and more!)
- Daily Calories and Protein intake to gain, lose or maintain weight!
- Progression Latter based on your max lifts!
